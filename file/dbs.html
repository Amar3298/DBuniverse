          while Krillin has become a police officer.[16] The God of Destruction Beerus prophesizes of a Super Saiyan God
          and upon waking begins a search for the figure. The search leads him to King Kai's planet where he outclasses
          a Super Saiyan 3 Goku, before turning his eyes to Vegeta on Earth. Beerus enjoyed his time on Earth until he
          was angered by the ungenerous Majin Buu for not sharing his pudding. The Z Fighters team up to take out Beerus
          but his power was too much for them.</p>

          the Super Saiyan God. Goku uses the Dragon Balls to summon Shenron and learns that a ritual is performed to
          make the Super Saiyan God. After achieving this state, Goku begins another battle with Beerus. In the end
          result of Beerus winning, Beerus leaves to go back to his planet and sleep. Sorbet and the rest of the Third
          Stellar Region are failing to find Dragons Balls and their empire starts to crumble by the day so they set out
          to revive Frieza. After Frieza has been revived, he seeks revenge on Goku and trains for four months. During
          this time, Goku and Vegeta are being trained by Whis to grow stronger in their base, and Videl gives birth to

          revealed that there are twelve universes in all, and Goku and Vegeta are from Universe Seven, and Champa is
          the God of Destruction of Universe 6. Upon being stunned by the delicacies of Earth, Champa and Beerus
          arranges a Tournament of Destroyers. If Champa wins, he will swap the Earth of Universe 7 with the extinct
          Earth of his universe. If Beerus wins, he will obtain the six Super Dragon Balls Champa has been secretly
          collecting throughout the two universes. Team Universe 7, consisting of Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, Majin Buu and
          the mysterious Monaka face off against Team Universe 6, Frost, Hit, Botamo, Cabba and Auta Magetta. Team
          Universe 7 wins after Goku surrenders in his final match with Hit, stating that he wants to fight him in full
          power, prompting Hit to intentionally eliminate himself against the shockingly useless Monaka in the final
          match. As Champa is about to incur his wrath against his own tournament candidates, Zeno, the King of All
          Gods, appears and says that he has been observing the event, and hopes to set up a similar tournament, with
          contestants from all twelve universes. Zeno leaves, and Beerus utilizes the Super Dragon Balls to resurrect
          Universe 6's planet Earth along with its inhabitants.</p>

          adventure, where Goku faces off against Duplicate Vegeta. Some time later, Future Trunks uses his time machine
          to escape from his dystopian timeline, where Future Bulma and millions have perished from the mysterious
          threat known as Goku Black, a mysterious but sinister doppelganger of Goku. Arriving in the present, Trunks
          reunites with the Z Fighters and meets Beerus and Whis. Goku Black invades their timeline to seek Future
          Trunks, and ends up fighting with Goku. However, a distortion pulls him back to Future Trunks' timeline.
          Realizing that Black was using a mystical artifact known as the Time Ring, which only belongs to the Supreme
          Kais, along with Goku, Beerus & Whis travel to Universe 10, to apprehend Gowasu, who has the Time Ring, and
          his apprentice Zamasu, who possesses identical ki to Black. Zamasu despises all mortals due to their
          aggressive nature and their inevitable drive to start conflict and wars, which he believes is something that
          can never be prevented as long as they aren't destroyed. After he is easily defeated by Goku, Zamasu becomes
          fanatically obsessed with the Universe 7's imprudent warrior, who he realizes, has divine ki, which makes him

            Goku, Vegeta and Future Trunks head into the future and are shocked to see Black with another counterpart of
            Zamasu. They get defeated and head back to the past. Zamasu's beliefs of mortal extinction is strengthened
            after he sees more barbaric violence initiated by the mortals in the far future and later the Destroyer's
            Tournament, which makes him infuriated at the irresponsibility of the other gods, who he believes is not
            taking their job seriously. He confronts Zuno and forces him to tell him everything about the Super Dragon
            Balls and Goku. Shin informs of this event to the Z Fighters. Beerus, Goku, Whis & Supreme Kai head to
            Universe 10 where they witness Zamasu assassinating Gowasu in order to steal the Time Ring. Whis uses his

            the future where they see that Goku Black and Zamasu are still present. Black reveals that he is indeed
            Zamasu. Before Future Trunks created a new timeline by going to the past, in the original timeline, Zamasu
            still met Goku, assassinated Gowasu, stole his Time Ring, and used the Super Dragon Balls to swap bodies
            with Goku whose power he lusts over and later kills him and his family. Realizing his own timeline is doomed
            beyond repair, he uses the Ring to travel to the timeline of Future Trunks and seeks a new ally, this
            timeline's version of Zamasu. They wreak havoc on multiple planets and universes, killing all gods, and
            reach to Earth as their final act of genocide, after every other part of the cosmos are wiped out,
            continuing their Zero Mortals Plan. Also, it is revealed that Future Zamasu used the now-destroyed Super
            Dragon Balls of their timeline to attain immortality.</p>

        <p class="lead">After that event, minor events revolve around some of the characters. Some time later, at Goku's
          request, the two Zeno's decide to organize a tournament including all twelve universes, called the Tournament
          of Power, which will take place in the Null Realm. In the Zeno Expo, Great Priest reveals that this tournament
          is not only made for recreational purposes, in fact, the Zeno's were planning to get rid of the weaker
          universes all along and this tournament will also serve as a judging basis for them to do so, with the four
          universes that were at the top of Zeno's mortal level scale, being spared automatically.</p>

        <p class="lead">However, before the actual Tournament begins, Future Zeno wishes to see an exhibition match to
          experience the thrill beforehand. The Grand Priest accedes and a warm up tournament is setup between Universe
          7 and Universe 9. Majin Buu, Gohan and Goku respectively defeat the wolfish fighters Basil, Lavender, and
          Bergamo with Goku revealing his Super Saiyan Blue form, thus surprising all the Gods of Destruction. After
          Goku wins, a mysterious fighter by the name of Top wishes to fight Goku, considering himself a servant of
          justice and the latter as evil. An intense battle begins with Toppo dislocating Goku's shoulder and Super
          Saiyan Blue Goku delivering a Kamehameha at point blank range. Toppo survives but the Great Priest stops the
          battles before one of them dies before the tournament. Before leaving, Toppo reveals that he is not the
          strongest fighter in Universe 11 but it is his friend Jiren, who will destroy Goku for sure. The Great Priest
          announces that the tournament will begin in 40 Earth hours and all the Universes depart. Goku returns to Earth
          and, along with Gohan, sets out to recruit 8 other members. Vegeta agrees to participate after Bulma gives
          birth to their daughter, Bulla. Goku recruits Piccolo, Master Roshi, Androids 17 and 18, Tien, and Krillin.
          Majin Buu is selected but falls asleep and Goku chooses Frieza as a replacement, much to everyone's horror.
          Everyone arrives at the World of Void for the tournament and a chaotic battle royal ensues between all the
          eight universes.</p>

        <p class="lead">Powerful new warriors prove their worth in the battlefield and Universe 7 defeats Universes 9,
          which is promptly erased. The tournament proceeds, and Universe 6's Saiyan warriors Kale and Caulifla continue
          to break their limits throughout the battle royal. Shortly, Universe 10 is erased after their last fighter
          Obni is defeated by Gohan. As half of the time goes by in the tournament, Goku faces off against the mightiest
          mortal, Jiren, whose power is rumored to be in the domain of the Gods of Destruction. During his intense
          battle with Jiren, Goku falls after his plan to release the Spirit Bomb, but he ends up obtaining a godly
          state known as Ultra Instinct, which allows him to dodge any attack without having to think, in exchange of
          putting unconditional faith on his own body. Goku ultimately loses and proceeds to battle the other universes.
          Universe 6's strongest fighter Hit is unpredictably eliminated by Jiren. Goku defeats Kefla, the fusion of
          Kale and Caulifla, by reactivating his Ultra Instinct and erupting a mighty Kamehameha at her, throwing her
          out of the ring. Promptly, Universe 2 and their love warriors and Universe 6 and their last Namekian fighters
          are erased by the combined efforts of Universe 7, who also clear up Universe 4 and it's fighting team,
          comprised of cunning superpowered extraterrestrials of diverse races, briefly.</p>

        <p class="lead">Universe 3's mightiest warriors fuse together to create the towering and gigantic winged
          monster, Agnilasa, who is defeated by the combined powers of the seventh universe, causing Universe 3 to get
          erased. The final warriors remaining in the stage are Goku, Vegeta, Gohan, Frieza and 17, who have to face off
          against Universe 11's Jiren, Toppo & Dyspo. Gohan eliminates himself in the process to take down Dyspo with
          him with the help of Frieza. Toppo, infuriated at his inability to stand a chance against Universe 7, leaves
          behind all his ideals and motivations to turn into a God of Destruction. Frieza is pummeled by Toppo, who is
          eliminated in a frenzied attack by Vegeta. Jiren finally decides to release his true power, and starts to drop
          his calm and composed attitude. It is revealed that Jiren's family and allies were all ravaged by an evildoer
          in the past, and that Jiren has lost all his faith in humanity and friendship or trust after his own allies
          betrayed him when they abandoned him out of fear of getting the same fate as their fallen friends. Jiren's
          mind broke, and so did his will. Traumatized, Jiren convinced himself that strength was absolute, that
          strength forgives all, even the past, as the strength of the evildoer was enough to destroy the hopes of Jiren
          and his allies. Jiren trained endlessly all these years, reveling in his own unstoppable growing strength to
          suppress his frustrations and enforcing his own brand of justice against evil by enlisting in the Pride
          Troopers, vowing to never let anything like his past ever happen in the future again.</p>

          Jiren. Vegeta is knocked out by Jiren, who gives all of his energy away to Goku, putting his trust in his
          fellow Saiyan. Goku taps into Ultra Instinct again, and goes toe to toe with Jiren, and finally, he masters
          the godly form. Goku proceeds to defeat Jiren, who starts going through a mental breakdown, devastated that
          all of his years of training and his ideals were all shattered by Goku, who proved that friendship and unity
          could be used as a drive to victory. Before he is able to eliminate Jiren who has started to acknowledge the
          Saiyan warrior's words, Goku's body suffers from using Ultra Instinct repetitively and he collapses. However,
          it is revealed that both Frieza and Android 17, who has survived his explosion, are still in the ring.</p>

          will. Although, initially, Frieza planned to clear up the strong enemies and then later betray Universe 7 to
          steal the Super Dragon Balls for himself and use it's power to turn the gods against each other and receive
          unimaginable strength, he realizes that Jiren's power is too much for even him to handle. Frieza reluctantly
          accepts to team up with Goku to save Universe 7, throwing away his selfish goals of obtaining the Super Dragon
          Balls to defeat their opponent in the face of erasure. Putting their complete trust in each other despite
          being enemies, Goku and Frieza unite their strength to eliminate Jiren. However, they are eliminated in the
          process. Universe 11 is erased and Android 17, the last person standing in the tournament, uses the Super
          Dragon Balls to restore all the erased universes. The Grand Minister reveals that Zeno foresaw the outcome of
          the tournament, and that if the victor used the Super Dragon Balls for a selfish wish, he would destroy
          everything in existence. The tournament would serve as a great message to gods of the different universes to
          balance the order of their own respective universes.</p>
